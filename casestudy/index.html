     <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
     <p>
          For this final project, I was tasked with creating an interface that includes several interconnected microinteractions.
          After focusing on a responsive drop-down menu for my Alpha and Beta interactions, I decided to try something a bit more difficult (and useful!) for my final.
          <br>
          The result is a gallery that's been designed for use on my portfolio. Hovering over one of the five images causes it to display some text,
          and clicking on it opens a modal detailing my work.
     </p>
     <h1>CONTEXT AND CHALLENGE</h1>
     <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
     <p>
          Up until the Final assignment in this class, I had been redesigning drop-down menus for the site of SEMGeeks, a Belmar, NJ-based startup I interned for in 2018.
     </p>

     <p>
          By my beta, however, I had decided that I wanted to focus on something I could rework into my portfolio site, as I hadn't updated it in a while.
     </p>
     <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
     <p>
          My portfolio's way of displaying my work was clunky. It consisted of 4 different buttons for 4 different categories, each of which opened into a seperate page that displayed the projects for that category.
          It was functional, but not intuitive. Forcing the user to jump from page to page gets overwhelming. Additionally, I wanted my portfolio to reflect my level of comfortability with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
     </p>
     <h2>GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</h2>
     <p>
          My goal was simple: find a way to condense all of the page-jumping content of my portfolio into a single group of microinteractions on a single page.
     </p>
     <h1>PROCESS AND INSIGHT</h1>
     <p>
          When I brought this idea up to my teacher, he suggested creating a variation on an image gallery. Looking through CodePen,
          I was able to find a very smooth example to base my code off of.
     </p>
     <div class="image_box">
          <img class="gif" src="images/example2.gif">
     </div>
     <p>
          From there, I began creating special hover states that allowed for text to appear overtop of the image when it was hovered.
          I wanted this bit to feel seamless, so I paid special care to the animation times in order for it to all feel like one smooth animation.
          <br><br>
          Next, I created 5 modals. Each would only be visible when its category had been selected from the gallery.
          I transferred the content from my portfolio, and was finally able to access all of my work from one microinteraction group. 
     </p>
     <h1>THE SOLUTION</h1>
     <div class="toplink_box">
          <a href="https://liammailley.com/idm241/final/build" class="toplink">Try it here!</a>
     </div>
     <h1>THE RESULTS</h1>
          <p>
          The completed final achieves all of my goals for this project. Each microinteraction plays into the next, creating a sense of motion throughout the whole product.
          I'm excited to implement this into my portfolio and I think it will improve both the navigation of my site and its sense of style.
